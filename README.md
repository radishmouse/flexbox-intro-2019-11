# What is Flexbox?

- Flexible Box model specification
- Provides "stretchy" containers and nicely aligned children in those containers

# Why was it created? What problems does it solve?

- Doing layout with just the box model + positioning == sucks
- For layout, it's the right tool for the job

# What is a flex container (a.k.a Flex parent)?



# What are flex items (or children)?

# What is the main axis?

# What is the cross axis?
