# What is Flexbox?

- Flexible Box model specification
- Provides "stretchy" containers and nicely aligned children in those containers

# Why was it created? What problems does it solve?

- Doing layout with just the box model + positioning == sucks
- For layout, it's the right tool for the job

# What is a flex container (a.k.a Flex parent)?

- it's an element with `display: flex`
- it controls how its children line up

# What are flex items (or children)?

- The *direct* children of a flex parent

# What is the main axis?

- the imaginary line on which the children sit

# How do you change the direction of the main axis?

- Set the `flex-direction` property


# What is the cross axis?

- It's an imaginary line that runs perpendicular to the main axis
- The parent can control how the children line up in that direction, too.
